/**
 * Cadence gate.
 *
 * The previous gate asked whether pages were earning Google impressions before
 * allowing more publishing. That is the wrong question for an AEO goal: AI
 * citation and Google rank are largely decoupled - most pages AI engines cite do
 * not rank in Google's top 10 - so a page can be invisible in Search and still be
 * cited, or rank and never be cited. Gating publication on Search surfacing
 * measured the wrong thing, and because it never returned a non-zero exit it
 * could not have stopped anything anyway.
 *
 * This gates on freshness and volume, which are the two levers the evidence
 * actually ties to citation:
 *
 *   - Pages not updated within 13 weeks are markedly more likely to lose AI
 *     citations, and recency correlates strongly with being cited at all.
 *   - Publishing faster than a library can be maintained guarantees the tail
 *     ages past that threshold. The ceiling is therefore not a taste question:
 *     it is refresh capacity multiplied by the refresh window.
 *
 * Four blocking conditions, each with an exit code so a pipeline can act on it:
 *
 *   1. new pages in the last 7 days above the weekly cap
 *   2. share of pages older than the refresh window above the tolerance
 *   3. URLs with no lastmod at all - a crawler gets no freshness signal
 *   4. library larger than refresh capacity can keep inside the window
 *
 * It also warns, without blocking, when a very high share of pages carry the
 * same recent lastmod. That is the signature of a date bump rather than a
 * substantive refresh, and it is worth seeing rather than being rewarded by the
 * freshness rules above.
 *
 * This script is read-only with respect to data/cadence/known_urls.json, and
 * that is load-bearing. See the note above the report write below.
 *
 * Usage: node cadence_gate.js [--json] [--policy path]

// can see exactly which URLs are exempt by reading that file. An unreadable or
// absent registry exempts nothing.
//
// Section indexes stay inside urls.size, so staleness, the ceiling and the
// lastmod checks below all still count them: they are pages a crawler fetches
// either way. Only the publication cadence cap ignores them, and they are
// reported as a warning rather than passing silently.
