/**
 * No orphan scripts.
 *
 * Every executable under scripts/ must be reachable from something that runs it:
 * an npm script, a workflow, a shell script, or a require/import in another file.
 * A script nothing calls is not neutral. In this repo the orphans were of two
 * dangerous kinds:
 *
 *   - three validators under scripts/validation/ that nothing ran. A guard
 *     nothing invokes enforces nothing, and one of them had silently rotted into
 *     reporting the entire link graph as broken, which is why it stayed unwired.
 *   - a second IndexNow submitter with the API key hardcoded in it, duplicating
 *     the live submitter that deploy_distribution.sh drives. Two submitters means
 *     one of them is wrong and nobody finds out which.
 *
 * A dead script is either deleted or wired. There is no allowlist here on
 * purpose: "one-shot, keep it around" is how every one of them survived. If a
 * one-shot must be kept, wire it behind an npm script so the wiring is visible.
 *
 * What counts as a caller is deliberately narrow. A prose mention of a filename
 * is not a caller, so this file excludes itself from the corpus and names no
 * orphan by filename above - a validator its own comments satisfy proves nothing.
 * A reference must be an invocation in a runner (package.json, workflow YAML,
 * shell) or a module specifier in code.
